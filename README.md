# JGame Framework
The JGame framework contains classes and packages useful when creating a new Java Game. Very easy to use, it handles images, FPS, keyboard entry, game objects, among other things.

See the WIKI (https://github.com/JeremieBeaudoin-Dion/Java-Game-Engine/wiki) for more explanations on what it does and how to use it.
